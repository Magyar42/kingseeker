Computer Science A-Level - Programming Project

KINGSEEKER is a roguelite game with a retro/pixel artstyle. Inspired by games such as Hades and Dead Cells, the project follows the story and gameplay of the original Dark Souls.

The project is being developed as course-work for my computer science A-level. As such, it is likely that the game will not be fully completed, or will feature the entirety of Dark Souls's plot and contents. Furthermore, as it is a project for school, it will likely not be receiving many updates once the deadline has been reached.
